    "1-Importing the necessary libraries: We begin by importing the pyautogui library, which provides functions to control the mouse and keyboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "2-Adding a delay: The time.sleep(8) line introduces an 8-second delay before the code execution starts. This delay allows you to switch to the desired window or application where you want the message to be printed.\n",

    "3-Looping through the range: The for loop iterates over the range 1, indicating that the message will be printed once.\n",

    "\n",
    "5-Pressing enter: The pg.press('enter') line simulates pressing the Enter key, which sends the message to the active window."
